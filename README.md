# Black-Tape-Project

This is my own custom framework. It is solely intended for web projects I build, but I am very open to comments and suggestions for changes.

> *Please note: You're welcome to use this starter kit for your own projects. It comes as-is and I don't offer much support for it because it's my own tool for my own use. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, I'll do my best to help but I can't guarantee a response or solution.*

## Class Naming

[namespace] [-ModuleOrComponent] [__ChildNode] [--variant]

## SCSS Ordering

```scss
.namespace {  
	&-ModuleOrComponent {  
		&--variant {  
		}  
	}  
	&__ChildNode {  
		&--variant {  
		}  
	}  
	.HTML {  
	}  
}  
```
